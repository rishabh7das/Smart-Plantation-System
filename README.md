ðŸŸ¥ RED STANDS FOR VCC        
â¬› BLACK STANDS FOR GND  
ðŸŸ© GREEN STANDS FOR ANALOG DATA   
ðŸŸ§ ORANGE STANDS FOR DIGITAL DATA   

### Working
All the black connections are ground in the circuit diagram.
There are 3 GND pins in the Arduino and we can connect to any one of the 3                                    GND pins. GND is connected to each and every sensor in the circuit. All the red connections means the VCC which means the power supply.
All the sensors used in the circuit require only 5 volts of current to function and that 5 volt of current will be provided by the Arduino itself through the medium of VCC. Rest all the connections, made in the circuit diagram responds to all the data pins in the circuit. Either we will Provide/Fetch analog data or we will Fetch/Provide digital data. And data will be in form of electric signals.
Now we need to understand why we have connected some sensors to Analog pins and some sensors to Digital pins.
#### ANALOG PINS
Soil moisture sensor will give a range of value so it is connected to analog pin. Light sensor will also give a range of values so it is connected to analog pin.
Now we have connected Oled screen to two analog pins. Basically, Oled screen has 4 pins VCC, GND, SCL and SDA. SCL is the clock pin over here. As Oled screen is based on an old technology so the function of SCL is to synchronize the pixels on the screen. SDA is the data pin where the corresponding pixels which have received the signal will light up. and both the pins has to be analog pins as said by the manufacturer of Arduino and that two pins will be A4 and A5. The Arduino has a data bus of 10 bits and it provides 10 bits corresponding analog value to the Arduino. 



#### DIGITAL PINS
Buzzer is connected to digital pins because a buzzer can perform only two operations either it will ring or it wonâ€™t just like a digital signal giving output either 0 or 1. Similarly for water pump if the plant does not have adequate moisture, it will pump water through the help of motor in the soil or else if the plant has enough moisture for the plant to survive it wonâ€™t pump water. So basically, it also works as a digital device. Similarly for relay if there is enough grow light the bulb will not go on and if there is not enough light the bulb will go on now comes the interesting fact that why we have connected temperature and humidity sensor to the digital pins. A question may arise that it can also give a range of values and it must also be connected to analog pin set of the Arduino. So, we have used DHT 11 sensor over here if we closely look at the sensor there are 3 pins on the sensor. basically GND, DATA, VCC. Here the data pin works in a different manner. There is a chip inserted in the data pin of the sensor. ADC chip which converts analog signals to digital signals and therefore gives output in the form of digital signals. No other sensor has an ADC in built inside the sensor. Connection of light bulb in the project. GND and VCC is required, GND is connected to 240V main GND but the VCC of the light bulb is connected to the relay and one end of the relay is connected to the 240 main power supply and the digital pin which is connected to the relay is defining to either make or break the connection in the relay.
When all the sensors are in position and the connection is turned on the sensors will function according to the code burned in the Arduino. The sensors will detect the moisture, light, temperature, humidity respectively and will display the collected data in the OLED Screen. If the moisture in the soil will be less the soil moisture sensor will detect it and the water will get pumped in the soil. If the water supply gets exhausted then the buzzer will go on indicating that the plant needs more water. In that case we need to fill the water supply again or if the plant has received enough moisture the water supply will cut off. Same goes for the light sensor, if the plant has received enough GROW light to survive the bulb will go off. The entire code is written in such a way that the plant will get all the required elements to survive in the right amount and as soon as it reaches the maximum level the supply will go off so that there is no harm to the plant.
